# Credit Score Classification System

This is a project that aims to build a credit score classification system based on a dataset of customer information. The system is able to predict the creditworthiness of customers and classify them into different categories based on their credit score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[username]/credit-score-classification-system.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `credit_score_classification.ipynb` in your IDE.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `credit_score_classification.ipynb` in your IDE.
2. Run the code cells in the notebook to load and preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the performance of the model.
3. Once the model has been trained, you can use it to predict the creditworthiness of new customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as age, income, and loan amount, as well as their credit score. The dataset is located in the file `credit_data.csv`.

## Model

The model used in this project is a random forest classifier. It was chosen because it is well-suited for classification tasks and is able to handle non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The results of the evaluation can be found in the notebook.

## Acknowledgments

- The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform for data science competitions and datasets.
- This project was inspired by the work of many data scientists and machine learning practitioners who have developed credit scoring models and shared their insights online.
