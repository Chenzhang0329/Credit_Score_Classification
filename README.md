\section{Getting Started}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 3
    \item Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clone the repository: \verb|git clone https://github.com/[username]/credit-score-classification-system.git|
    \item Install the required packages: \verb|pip install -r requirements.txt|
    \item Open the Jupyter Notebook file \verb|credit_score_classification.ipynb| in your IDE.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Usage}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the Jupyter Notebook file \verb|credit_score_classification.ipynb| in your IDE.
    \item Run the code cells in the notebook to load and preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the performance of the model.
    \item Once the model has been trained, you can use it to predict the creditworthiness of new customers.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dataset}

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as age, income, and loan amount, as well as their credit score. The dataset is located in the file \verb|credit_data.csv|.

\section{Model}

The model used in this project is a random forest classifier. It was chosen because it is well-suited for classification tasks and is able to handle non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

\section{Evaluation}

The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The results of the evaluation can be found in the notebook.

\section{License}

\section{Acknowledgments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The dataset used in this project was obtained from \verb|Kaggle|, a platform for data science competitions and datasets.
    \item This project was inspired by the work of many data scientists and machine learning practitioners who have developed credit scoring models and shared their insights online.
\end{itemize}
